# [Multiple application instances](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/application.html#multiple-application-instances)

You are not limited to a single application instance on the same page. The createApp API allows multiple Vue applications to co-exist on the same page, each with its own scope for configuration and global assets:

```js
const app1 = createApp({
  /* ... */
})
app1.mount('#container-1')

const app2 = createApp({
  /* ... */
})
app2.mount('#container-2')
```

If you are using Vue to enhance server-rendered HTML and only need Vue to control specific parts of a large page, avoid mounting a single Vue application instance on the entire page. Instead, create multiple small application instances and mount them on the elements they are responsible for.
