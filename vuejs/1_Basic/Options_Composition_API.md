In Vue.js, **Options API** and **Composition API** are two approaches to defining components. Here's a comparison:

### **1. Options API**
- **Structure**: Logic is divided into specific options (`data`, `methods`, `computed`, `watch`, etc.).
- **Readability**: Easy to understand for beginners because responsibilities are well-separated.
- **Code Organization**: Component logic can feel scattered across various sections.
- **Reusability**: Harder to extract and reuse logic across components.
- **Usage**: Preferred for small to medium projects or when starting with Vue.js.

### Example:
```javascript
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0
    };
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++;
    }
  }
};
```

### **2. Composition API**
- **Structure**: Logic is grouped together, often using JavaScript functions and hooks.
- **Readability**: Can be harder for beginners but scales well for larger applications.
- **Code Organization**: Related logic is encapsulated in one place, making it easier to maintain.
- **Reusability**: Enables reusability of logic by creating custom composables (reusable functions).
- **Usage**: Preferred for larger or more complex projects where flexibility and scalability are essential.

### Example:
```javascript
import { ref } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0);
    const increment = () => {
      count.value++;
    };
    return { count, increment };
  }
};
```

### **When to Use Which?**
- Use **Options API** for simpler, less complex applications.
- Use **Composition API** for complex applications where logic reuse, readability, and maintainability are priorities. It also aligns better with modern Vue.js features and ecosystem tools.
