# [Writable Computed](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed.html#writable-computed)

Computed properties are by default getter-only. If you attempt to assign a new value to a computed property, you will receive a runtime warning. In the rare cases where you need a "writable" computed property, you can create one by providing both a getter and a setter:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'

const firstName = ref('John')
const lastName = ref('Doe')

const fullName = computed({
  // getter
  get() {
    return firstName.value + ' ' + lastName.value
  },
  // setter
  set(newValue) {
    // Note: we are using destructuring assignment syntax here.
    [firstName.value, lastName.value] = newValue.split(' ')
  }
})
</script>
```

Now when you run `fullName.value = 'John Doe'`, the setter will be invoked and `firstName` and `lastName` will be updated accordingly.

# Getting the Previous Value

In case you need it, you can get the previous value returned by the computed property accessing the first argument of the getter:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'

const count = ref(2)

// This computed will return the value of count when it's less or equal to 3.
// When count is >=4, the last value that fulfilled our condition will be returned
// instead until count is less or equal to 3
const alwaysSmall = computed((previous) => {
  if (count.value <= 3) {
    return count.value
  }

  return previous
})
</script>
```
In case you're using a writable computed:
```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'

const count = ref(2)

const alwaysSmall = computed({
  get(previous) {
    if (count.value <= 3) {
      return count.value
    }

    return previous
  },
  set(newValue) {
    count.value = newValue * 2
  }
})
</script>
```


# Best Practices

1. [Getters should be side-effect free](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed.html#getters-should-be-side-effect-free)
2. [Avoid mutating computed value](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed.html#avoid-mutating-computed-value)
