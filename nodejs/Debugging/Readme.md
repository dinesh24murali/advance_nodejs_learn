# How to run?

Step 1:

Make sure there is at least one `debugger` in the code.

Step 2:

Use the following command to run the js file in inspect mode. The env variable `NODE_INSPECT_RESUME_ON_START=1` will make the inspector to stop execution on the 1st debugger.
```
NODE_INSPECT_RESUME_ON_START=1 node inspect index.js
```

Step 3:

Once you are at the debugger you can use the following commands when the execution is paused at the debugger.

1. `exec` is used to execute a command

Example:
`exec('a')` to print the value of variable `a`
`exec('sum(a,b)');` to call a function called `sum()` with arguments `a`, `b`.

2. `cont` is used to continue to next `debugger;`

3. `next` is used to go to the next line

Point 1:
She got hurt because I people pleased a little bit after I came to bangalore from Chikmagaluru. I went for dinner with Suri anna. I was equally in pain and equally in hunger, so I was inclined to go. When I am in pain I cannot be 100% mindful.  
Point 2:
She keeps telling me everyone treats her like a queen in terms of emotions. As a husband I am expected to treat her the same way or even higher. She herself says that it is unfair. I am not saying that I won't do it. I can't start doing that in day one. I will make mistakes occasionally. I am working on it.
Point 3:
She gave me one more reason as to why she got angry when I went to dinner with suri anna. I could have see her a bit earlier if I went home instead of going to the hotel. She said I had options.
Point 4:
I told her I am going out for shopping, after trying hard to console her. But she didn't budge. So I went out to do what she asked me to do, make a window screen for the bathroom. When I stepped out of the house she told me to stay some where else for a few days. Remember I stepped outside to do what she wanted me to do.

My problem:
I hate her micro-management, it gives me no ground to stand on. In her perspective anything she thinks can be considered as a mistake when she micro-manages.

My plan:
I am not going to talk to her until she comes down with her expectation. I am not going to get provoked. I am not going to cry. I am going to be cold, very cold and calm, even of she breaks my laptop, my monitor, my office laptop.

I won't tell my parent's about it for now. I will tell them Tuesday night after she leaves from Bangalore.

If she continuous fighting until wednesday night I won't be going to Pattukottai, and Cochin.

I want things to get better, this is my highest priority. I am mildly considering divorce.

Keep thinking about git. Keep thinking about improving. Keep thinking about starting a startup / non-profit. This will give value to you. This will distract you from her.
