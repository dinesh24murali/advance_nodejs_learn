# Global (globalThis)

In Node.js, global is an object that provides a way to define variables or functions that are accessible throughout the entire application, across all modules. It's the equivalent of the global scope in browsers (where window or self is used). However, using global should generally be approached with caution due to potential side effects and maintainability issues.

## Uses of global in Node.js

### 1. Accessing Global Variables and Functions:

You can define variables or functions on the global object, making them accessible from anywhere in your application.

```js
// Define a global variable
global.myGlobalVar = 'This is a global variable';

// Define a global function
global.myGlobalFunction = function() {
    console.log('This is a global function');
};

// Accessing them from anywhere
console.log(myGlobalVar); // Output: This is a global variable
myGlobalFunction();       // Output: This is a global function
```

### 2. Sharing Data Across Modules

The global object can be used to share data or configuration settings across different modules without requiring them to be explicitly passed or imported.

```js
// In one module (e.g., config.js)
global.config = {
    appName: 'MyApp',
    port: 3000
};

// In another module (e.g., app.js)
console.log(global.config.appName); // Output: MyApp
```

### 3. Avoiding Repetitive Imports

By attaching commonly used utilities or libraries to global, you can avoid repeatedly importing them in every module.

```js
// In a setup file (e.g., globalSetup.js)
global._ = require('lodash'); // Attach lodash to global

// In any module
console.log(_.isEmpty({})); // Output: true
```

### 4. Debugging and Prototyping

The global object can be useful during debugging or prototyping, where you need quick access to certain variables or functions across different parts of your application.

```js
// In your main file
global.debugMode = true;

if (global.debugMode) {
    console.log('Debug mode is ON');
}
```

## Important Considerations

### 1. Avoid Overusing global

Overusing global can lead to code that is difficult to understand, maintain, and debug. Since global variables can be modified from anywhere in the application, they can introduce unexpected behavior and make it hard to track where changes are made.

### 2. Namespace Pollution

Using global can lead to namespace pollution, where different modules may accidentally overwrite each other's variables or functions. This can cause hard-to-diagnose bugs, especially in large applications.

### 3. Memory Leaks

Variables attached to global persist for the lifetime of the application, which can lead to memory leaks if they hold large amounts of data or are not cleaned up properly.

### 4. Security Risks

Exposing sensitive data or functions globally can be a security risk, as they are accessible from anywhere in the application.

## Example of a Potential Problem

```js
// Module A
global.config = { dbHost: 'localhost' };

// Module B (accidentally overwrites global.config)
global.config = { dbHost: 'remotehost' };

// Module C (expects the original global.config)
console.log(global.config.dbHost); // Output: 'remotehost' instead of 'localhost'
```

## When to Use global

- For truly global application settings: When you have application-wide settings or configurations that are relevant across all modules.
- For prototyping or quick scripts: When building small, simple applications or during initial development stages.
- For debugging: Temporarily storing data or functions globally to inspect them during debugging.

In general, itâ€™s better to avoid using global and instead use module exports, dependency injection, or configuration management libraries to share data and functionality across modules. This approach promotes cleaner, more modular, and maintainable code.
