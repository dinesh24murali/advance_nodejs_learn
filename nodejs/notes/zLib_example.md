# zlib package

The zlib package in Node.js provides compression functionality, implementing the popular zlib compression library. It supports various compression methods including Gzip, Deflate, and Brotli, allowing you to compress and decompress data streams and buffers. This is useful for tasks such as reducing the size of data for storage or transmission over a network.

### Key Features

1. `Compression and Decompression`: The zlib module provides methods for compressing and decompressing data using different algorithms.
2. `Stream Support`: It can work with Node.js streams, making it suitable for real-time data compression.
3. `Buffer Support`: It can also compress and decompress buffers directly.
