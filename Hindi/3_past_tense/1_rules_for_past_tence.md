### Rules of Sentence Formation in Hindi Past Tense  

In Hindi, **past tense** is used to describe actions or events that have already occurred. The structure of a past-tense sentence depends on the **gender**, **number**, and **person** of the subject as well as the **type of verb** used. Here's a breakdown:

---

### 1. **Basic Sentence Structure**
The general structure of past-tense sentences is:  
**Subject + Auxiliary (if needed) + Object + Main Verb (in past form)**  

Example:  
- मैं स्कूल गया। *(Main school gaya.)*  
  - Subject: मैं (I)  
  - Object: स्कूल (school)  
  - Verb: गया (went)

---

### 2. **Gender and Number Agreement**
In Hindi, the verb agrees with the **gender** and **number** of the subject or object (for transitive verbs):  

#### **Masculine Singular**
- **गया** (for "went")  
Example: वह बाजार गया। *(Vah bazaar gaya.)*  
(He went to the market.)

#### **Masculine Plural**
- **गए** (for "went")  
Example: वे बाजार गए। *(Ve bazaar gaye.)*  
(They went to the market.)

#### **Feminine Singular**
- **गई** (for "went")  
Example: वह बाजार गई। *(Vah bazaar gayi.)*  
(She went to the market.)

#### **Feminine Plural**
- **गईं** (for "went")  
Example: वे बाजार गईं। *(Ve bazaar gayin.)*  
(They [females] went to the market.)

### 3. **Transitive vs Intransitive Verbs**
- **Transitive verbs**: Require an object. Use **ने** with the subject.  
  Example: मैंने खाना खाया। *(Maine khaana khaya.)*  
  (I ate food.)  
  - "मैं" becomes "मैंने" because of the transitive verb "खाया" (ate).  

- **Intransitive verbs**: Do not require an object. No **ने** is used.  
  Example: वह सो गया। *(Vah so gaya.)*  
  (He slept.)

### 4. **Negative Sentences**
To form a negative sentence in past tense, add **नहीं** before the verb:  
- मैंने काम नहीं किया। *(Maine kaam nahin kiya.)*  
  (I did not work.)  
- वह स्कूल नहीं गया। *(Vah school nahin gaya.)*  
  (He did not go to school.)

---

### 5. **Interrogative Sentences**
To ask questions in past tense, start the sentence with a question word:  
- क्या तुमने खाना खाया? *(Kya tumne khaana khaya?)*  
  (Did you eat food?)  
- वह स्कूल कब गया? *(Vah school kab gaya?)*  
  (When did he go to school?)

### 6. **Helping Verbs**
Hindi past tense often does not require explicit auxiliary verbs, but they can be added for emphasis:  
- वह पढ़ रहा था। *(Vah padh raha tha.)*  
  (He was studying.)
