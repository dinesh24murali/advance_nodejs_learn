To determine whether a verb is **transitive** in Hindi (or any language), you can follow these guidelines:  

---

### **1. Definition of a Transitive Verb**  
A **transitive verb** is a verb that requires an object to complete its meaning. The action of the verb is transferred to the object.  
- Example:  
  - **‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç‡§®‡•á ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§** *(Maine khaana khaya.)*  
    - Verb: ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ (ate)  
    - Object: ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ (food)  
    The action "ate" needs an object ("food") to make sense.  

An **intransitive verb**, by contrast, does not need an object.  
- Example:  
  - **‡§µ‡§π ‡§∏‡•ã ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§** *(Vah so gaya.)*  
    - Verb: ‡§∏‡•ã (slept)  
    The action "slept" is complete without an object.

### **2. Ask the "What?" or "Whom?" Question**  
To determine whether a verb is transitive, ask the following questions:  
- **What?** (‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ?)  
- **Whom?** (‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡•á?)  

If the verb answers one of these questions, it is transitive.  

#### Examples:
1. ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§¨ ‡§™‡§¢‡§º‡•Ä‡•§ *(Maine kitaab padhi.)*  
   - Verb: ‡§™‡§¢‡§º‡•Ä (read)  
   - Ask: ‡§™‡§¢‡§º‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ? (Read what?)  
   - Answer: ‡§ï‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§¨ (book)  
   **Result:** Transitive  

2. ‡§µ‡§π ‡§¶‡•å‡§°‡§º‡§æ‡•§ *(Vah dauda.)*  
   - Verb: ‡§¶‡•å‡§°‡§º‡§æ (ran)  
   - Ask: ‡§¶‡•å‡§°‡§º‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ? (Ran what?)  
   - No answer.  
   **Result:** Intransitive

### **3. Common Transitive Verbs in Hindi**  
Some verbs are almost always transitive in Hindi:  
- ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ (to eat)  
- ‡§™‡§¢‡§º‡§®‡§æ (to read)  
- ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ñ‡§®‡§æ (to write)  
- ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡§®‡§æ (to see)  
- ‡§∏‡•Å‡§®‡§®‡§æ (to listen/hear)  
- ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ (to do)  

These verbs generally require an object to complete their meaning.

### **4. Common Intransitive Verbs in Hindi**  
Some verbs are almost always intransitive:  
- ‡§∏‡•ã‡§®‡§æ (to sleep)  
- ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§æ (to go)  
- ‡§Ü‡§®‡§æ (to come)  
- ‡§¨‡•à‡§†‡§®‡§æ (to sit)  
- ‡§¶‡•å‡§°‡§º‡§®‡§æ (to run)  

These verbs do not require an object to make sense.

### **5. Some Verbs Can Be Both Transitive and Intransitive**  
Depending on the context, some verbs can function as either transitive or intransitive.  

#### Example 1: Transitive  
- ‡§â‡§∏‡§®‡•á ‡§ó‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§ *(Usne gaana gaya.)*  
  (He sang a song.)  
  - Verb: ‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ (sang)  
  - Object: ‡§ó‡§æ‡§®‡§æ (song)  
  **Result:** Transitive  

#### Example 2: Intransitive  
- ‡§µ‡§π ‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§ *(Vah gaya.)*  
  (He sang.)  
  - Verb: ‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ (sang)  
  - No object.  
  **Result:** Intransitive  

---

### **6. The Role of "‡§®‡•á" in Identifying Transitive Verbs in Hindi**  
In the **past tense**, Hindi uses the postposition **"‡§®‡•á"** with the subject when a verb is transitive.  

#### Example:  
- ‡§â‡§∏‡§®‡•á ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§ *(Usne khaana khaya.)*  
  - The subject "‡§â‡§∏‡§®‡•á" (he/she) has "‡§®‡•á," which indicates the verb ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ (ate) is transitive.  

For intransitive verbs, **"‡§®‡•á"** is not used:  
- ‡§µ‡§π ‡§∏‡•ã ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§ *(Vah so gaya.)*  
  - No "‡§®‡•á" is present because ‡§∏‡•ã (slept) is intransitive.

### **Quick Tip**
If you're ever unsure, check if the verb naturally makes sense without an object. If it doesn't, it's probably transitive!
