Here are some **problems** to practice using the **`for...in`** loop in JavaScript:

---

### **1. Count the Number of Keys in an Object**
Write a program that uses a `for...in` loop to count the number of keys in the following object:
```javascript
let book = {
  title: "JavaScript Essentials",
  author: "John Doe",
  year: 2021,
  pages: 350
};
```

### **2. Print Property Values of an Object**
Write a program that uses a `for...in` loop to print all the values of the properties in the object below:
```javascript
let student = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 20,
  grade: "A",
  subject: "Mathematics"
};
```

### **3. Sum of Object Values**
Write a program that calculates the sum of all numeric values in an object.  
For example:
```javascript
let scores = {
  math: 90,
  english: 85,
  history: 80
};
```

### **4. List All Keys in an Object**
Write a program that prints all the keys of the following object using the `for...in` loop:
```javascript
let car = {
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Camry",
  year: 2022,
  color: "blue"
};
```

### **5. Print All Values of an Array of Objects**
You are given an array of objects. Write a `for...in` loop to print the names and ages of all the people in the array:
```javascript
let people = [
  { name: "John", age: 25 },
  { name: "Jane", age: 30 },
  { name: "Jim", age: 35 }
];
```

### **6. Find Maximum Value in an Object**
Write a program that uses a `for...in` loop to find the maximum value from the following object of numbers:
```javascript
let numbers = {
  a: 10,
  b: 50,
  c: 30,
  d: 70
};
```

### **7. Reverse the Properties of an Object**
Write a program that reverses the order of properties in an object using the `for...in` loop.  
For example:
```javascript
let person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30
};
```

### **8. List the Indices of an Array**
Write a program that uses the `for...in` loop to list the indices of an array:
```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
```

### **9. Print Object Properties and Their Data Types**
Write a program that uses a `for...in` loop to print each property of an object and its corresponding data type:
```javascript
let product = {
  name: "Laptop",
  price: 1000,
  isAvailable: true
};
```

### **10. Create a Simple Inventory Counter**
Write a program that uses a `for...in` loop to count how many different types of products are in an inventory object.  
For example:
```javascript
let inventory = {
  apple: 10,
  banana: 5,
  orange: 8,
  mango: 3
};
```
