Here are some **problems** to practice using **`break`** and **`continue`** in JavaScript:

---

### **1. Break Problem: Print Numbers Until a Specific Condition**
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 20. If the number is divisible by 5, stop the loop using `break`.

---

### **2. Break Problem: Find the First Prime Number**
Write a program that uses a loop to find the first prime number between 1 and 50. Use `break` to stop the loop once the first prime number is found.

---

### **3. Continue Problem: Skip Even Numbers**
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 20, but skips all the even numbers using the `continue` statement.

---

### **4. Continue Problem: Print Only Vowels in a String**
Write a program that uses a `for` loop and the `continue` statement to print only the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') from a given string.

```javascript
let inputString = "Hello, World!";
```

---

### **5. Break Problem: Break the Loop After 3 Iterations**
Write a program that uses a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10. Break the loop after 3 iterations.

---

### **6. Continue Problem: Skip Numbers Divisible by 3**
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 15 but skips the numbers divisible by 3 using `continue`.

---

### **7. Break Problem: Sum of Numbers Until a Target Value**
Write a program that sums the numbers from 1 to 100. If the sum exceeds 300, break the loop and print the sum at that point.

---

### **8. Continue Problem: Count Non-Alphabet Characters**
Write a program that counts how many non-alphabet characters (e.g., digits, punctuation marks) are in a string. Skip the alphabet characters using `continue`.

```javascript
let sentence = "Hello World! 123";
```

---

### **9. Break Problem: Finding the First Negative Number**
Write a program that goes through an array of numbers and prints the first negative number it encounters. If no negative numbers are found, print "No negative numbers found". Use `break` to exit the loop after finding the first negative number.

```javascript
let numbers = [4, 7, 10, -5, 12];
```

---

### **10. Continue Problem: Skip All Numbers Greater Than 50**
Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 100 but skips numbers greater than 50 using `continue`.

---

### **11. Break Problem: Exit on Specific Value**
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 20. If the number 15 is encountered, exit the loop using `break`.

---

### **12. Continue Problem: Skip Vowels in a String**
Write a program that loops through each character of a string and skips vowels using the `continue` statement.

```javascript
let str = "JavaScript";
```

---

### **13. Break Problem: Find First Multiple of 7**
Write a program that finds the first multiple of 7 between 1 and 100 and prints it. Use `break` to stop the loop once a multiple of 7 is found.

---

### **14. Continue Problem: Skip Prime Numbers**
Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 20 except prime numbers using the `continue` statement.

---

### **15. Break Problem: Search for a Specific Word**
Write a program that loops through an array of strings. If the word "exit" is found, stop the loop using `break` and print "Exiting...".

```javascript
let words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "exit", "grape"];
```

---

### **16. Continue Problem: Count Spaces in a String**
Write a program that counts how many spaces are in a string, skipping non-space characters using the `continue` statement.

```javascript
let sentence = "This is a test string";
```
