Write a program that uses a `for...of` loop to sum up all the values in the following array:
```javascript
let scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88];
```

### **8. Find the Common Elements in Two Arrays**
Write a program that uses a `for...of` loop to find the common elements between two arrays:
```javascript
let array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let array2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
```

### **9. Create a New String by Joining Array Elements**
Write a program that uses a `for...of` loop to join all the elements of the following array into a single string, with each element separated by a space:
```javascript
let words = ["Hello", "world", "JavaScript", "is", "fun"];
```

### **10. Create a Frequency Counter for Characters in a String**
