Here are some **problems** to practice using the **`do...while`** loop in JavaScript:

---

### **1. Print Numbers from 1 to 10**
Write a program using a `do...while` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.

---

### **2. Reverse Countdown**
Write a program using a `do...while` loop to print a countdown from 10 to 1.

---

### **3. Sum of Positive Numbers**
Write a program that prompts the user to input positive numbers. The program should sum all the positive numbers and stop when the user inputs a negative number. The sum should be printed after the loop ends.

---

### **4. Find the First Even Number**
Write a program that uses a `do...while` loop to find the first even number in an array. If no even number is found, print a message saying "No even number found."

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10];
```

---

### **5. Ask for User's Age Until Valid**
Write a program using a `do...while` loop that repeatedly asks the user for their age. The age must be between 18 and 100. The program should stop once a valid age is entered.

---

### **6. Guess the Secret Number**
Write a program where the user has to guess a secret number between 1 and 10. The program should prompt the user to keep guessing until they get the correct answer (let's assume the number is 7).

---

### **7. Factorial of a Number**
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user using a `do...while` loop. The factorial should be computed as long as the number is greater than 0.

---

### **8. Print Multiplication Table**
Write a program using a `do...while` loop to print the multiplication table of a number provided by the user (e.g., multiplication table of 5).

---

### **9. Fibonacci Sequence**
Write a program that uses a `do...while` loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the `n`th term, where `n` is given by the user.

---

### **10. Count the Number of Vowels in a String**
Write a program that uses a `do...while` loop to count the number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') in a string entered by the user.

---

### **11. Calculate the Average of Positive Numbers**
Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to input positive numbers and calculates the average. The program should stop when the user enters a negative number.

---

### **12. Print Odd Numbers from 1 to 20**
Write a program using a `do...while` loop to print all odd numbers from 1 to 20.

---

### **13. Check Palindrome**
Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) using a `do...while` loop.

---

### **14. Convert a Decimal to Binary**
Write a program that converts a decimal number to binary using a `do...while` loop. The program should repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder.

---

### **15. Check if a Number is Prime**
Write a program that checks if a given number is prime using a `do...while` loop. The loop should continue checking the number until it is either confirmed to be prime or not.

---

### **16. Generate Multiples of 3 up to a Limit**
Write a program that generates all multiples of 3 up to a given limit (entered by the user) using a `do...while` loop.

---

### **17. Ask for Password Until Correct**
Write a program that repeatedly asks the user for a password. If the password is incorrect, it should prompt again until the correct password is entered.

---

### **18. Count Down Until Target**
Write a program that counts down from 100 to 1, stopping when it reaches a target value, which is specified by the user.

These problems will help you practice how to use the **`do...while`** loop to handle user input, repetitive tasks, and conditions that require the loop to run at least once. Let me know if you need help with any of them!
