Explain chrome DevTools.

### Step 1:

### Step 2:
Create a html file called `index.html`

### Step 3:
Create a `javascript` file called `index.js`

### Step 4:
Paste the following code into the html file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<script src="./index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 5:
Paste the following code into the javascript file:

```js
console.log(" Hello world ")
