# Non-Primitive data types

## Object

JavaScript object is a data structure that allows us to have key-value pairs; so we can have distinct keys and each key is mapped to a value that can be of any JavaScript data type. Comparing it to a real-world object, a pen is an object with several properties such as color, design, the material it is made of, etc. In the same way, JavaScript objects can have properties that define their characteristics.

### Need to practice:

- Methods to delete keys in object
  - delete keyword
  - assigning `undefined`
- Pass by reference in Objects, with functions
- Cloning objects using `JSON.stringify`
- Keys in object
- Spread operator using Objects.
- Destructuring with Objects.

## Arrays
Arrays are objects that store a collection of items and can be assigned to a variable. They have their methods that can perform operations on the array.


### Need to practice:
- Array built in methods:
  - push
  - pop
  - splice
  - unshift
  - indexOf
  - includes
  - concat
  - delete
  - slice
  - sort
- Check if a variable is an array
- Spread operator using Array
- destructuring with Array
